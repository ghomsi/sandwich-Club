# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Project Overview
This project is a **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project
help us to better understand how it is processed.
